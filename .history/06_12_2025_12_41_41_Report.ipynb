    "Data collection and analysis is an important and valuable tool for game development and improvement. Player characteristics analysis and its influence on player's behavior helps to identify patterns and create strategies for increasing game engagement and attracting more users. Since this report analyzes data from a game research project, using existing data for attracting new players can help to expand the project and strengthen the research.  \n",
    "In this report we want to determine if there is a relationship between the total hours played by user and their experience level. We are interested whether we can predict the time our new user will spend playing the game knowing their experience level. This data will help us to determine which users are most active on the server and which playtime corresponds to each experience category. This requires regression analysis, as we want to predict numerical value (hours) based on a categorical value (experience level). In this case, we use KNN regression to analyze the values closest to the new observation, in order to make a prediction about the hours new players will spend on the server.  \n",
    "This report shows how identifying patterns between previously known players characteristics can help researchers to predict players behavior in the future."

    "**Insights:** The stacked bar plot shows the total hours proportions by gender within each experience category. Male players play contribute the most hours in `Pro` and`Beginner` category, whereas female players contribute the most hours in Amateur category. We can see that `Veterans` represent the most gender diversity across all experience levels. Although most of the players are male, the distribution of hours played by gender vary in most of the experience levels. For instance, we only have 2 `Agender` users in dataset, and they contributed almost half of all hours played in `Veteran` group (which consists of 48 players) . This shows that total played time differs within users and shows no consistent patterns by gender.  \n",
